Windows software is available from the Keene Electronics site for the dongle they sell which is identical to the one I bought. I don't use Windows and I couldn't find a Linux program so I decided to write one.\r\n\r\nI don't have a lot of experience writing C or C++ software and even less using QT but I decided to learn on the job. I am sure my code could be improved but I wasn't looking to optimise it which, in my opinion, makes it difficult to read and understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
